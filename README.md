# TASTI Web Platform Wishlist Page

TASTI WEB PLATFORM is an innovative solution developed by [ACD Veri Mühendisliği](https://www.acd.com.tr/) within the TASTI project, designed to create synthetic images for industrial applications. The platform consists of four main synthetic image generation and analysis tools, as well as the integration of [GenerativeZoo](https://github.com/caetas/GenerativeZoo), an open-source image generation library.

## CamFITool
- Add various types of errors to existing images
- Adjust different distortion levels
- Automatically add noise, blur, and other anomalies
- Make artificially created errors realistic
- Create large datasets with batch processing

## CamGenTool
- Generate synthetic images based on sample images
- Create variations with different parameters
- Adjust position, color, and size of objects
- Customize image backgrounds and lighting conditions
- Produce large datasets with batch operations

## CamTrainTool
- Train LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models
- Customize models with custom datasets
- Fine-tune training parameters
- Analyze and evaluate model performance
- Monitor the training process visually

## CamQTool
- Analyze realism of synthetic images
- Assess image quality and clarity
- Perform histogram and texture analysis
- Compare with reference images
- Calculate quality scores with various metrics

## GenerativeZoo
GenerativeZoo is an innovative generative algorithm library developed using Python and PyTorch. Created within the Xecs TASTI project (nr. 2022005), it is a unique collection of 27 different models, brought together by standardized, user-friendly, and independent code structures. The library offers practical solutions to researchers and developers with comprehensive documentation and example scenarios.
